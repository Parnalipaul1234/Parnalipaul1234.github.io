   <p><b>[“Child labor and poverty are inevitably bound together and if you continue to use the labor of children as the treatment for the social disease of poverty, you will have both poverty and child labor to the end of time.”]
          <br> — Grace Abbott <p><b>
    <p>  In our daily life, we come across many people who we think are poor. They could be landless labourers in villages or people living in overcrowded slums (jhuggis)  in cities.They could be daily wage workers at construction sites or child workers in restrurants. They could also be beggars with children in tatters. We see poverty all around us. In fact, every fourth person in India is poor. This means, roughly 88 million people out of 1.2 billion Indians, roughly equal to 6.7% of India's population, lived below the poverty line of $1.25 in 2018–19. This also means that India has the largest single concentration of the poor in the world. This illustrates the seriousness of the challenge. Poor people are in a situation in which they are ill-treated at almost every place, in farms, factories, government offices, hospitals, railway stations etc. Obviously, nobody would like to live in poverty. One of the biggest challenges of independent India has been to bring millions of its people out of abject poverty.  Mahatama Gandhi always insisted that "India would be truly independent only when the poorest of its people become free of human suffering".

    <p> Since poverty has many facets, social scientists look at it through a variety of indicators. Usually the indicators used relate to the levels of income and consumption. But now poverty is looked through other social indicators like illiteracy level, lack of general resistance due to malnutrition, lack of access to healthcare, lack of job opportunities, lack of access to safe drinking water, sanitation etc. Analysis of poverty based on social exclusion and vulnerability is now becoming very common.</p>
